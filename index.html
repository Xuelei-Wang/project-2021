			<h1>What do you know about Coffee?</h1>
			<p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. When coffee berries turn from green to bright red in color – indicating ripeness – they are picked, processed, and dried. Dried coffee seeds (referred to as "beans") are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and then brewed with near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as coffee.</p>

			<h1>Why coffee so popular?</h1>
			<p>A 2017 review of clinical trials found that drinking coffee is generally safe within usual levels of intake and is more likely to improve health outcomes than to cause harm at doses of 3 or 4 cups of coffee daily. Exceptions include possible increased risk in women having bone fractures, and a possible increased risk in pregnant women of fetal loss or decreased birth weight. Results were complicated by poor study quality, and differences in age, gender, health status, and serving size.</p>

			<h1>New ways to make coffee!</h1>
			<p>Combine one sachet of 3-in-1 instant coffee, 1 tablespoon of refined cane sugar and two tablespoons of hot water in a bowl. Step 2: Whip, by hand or with a mixer. If you choose to do this manually, you'd have to mix the mixture at least 400 times. It will be tiring, but think of it as a good workout for your arm.</p>
